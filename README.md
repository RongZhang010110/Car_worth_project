Description
– How much is your car worth? Predict the sale price of a car based on its features and condition
Goal
– Construct a model to predict sale price of a used car based on its features and condition and use it to generate predictions for a set of unlabeled data.

My work:
The aim of PAC is to train a suitable predictive model from the analysis data and eventually apply it to the scoring data to obtain a lower RMSE. 17 independent variables and 1 dependent variable (rating) are included in the analysis data, but due to the redundancy of the content under the two variables performer and song, these two variables were not added to the analysis process in the I did not add these two variables to the analysis process in my model building. The database used for training therefore ended up with 16 independent variables and 1 dependent variable, and the whole analysis will be carried out in R studio.
